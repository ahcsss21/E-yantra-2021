<h3>Title of The Project</h3> Covid home management of mild and moderate infections.
<h3>Description</h3>
We want to build a website which acts as a guide to treat mild and moderate cases of Covid -19 at home. We chose this because it is extremely important to each individual to prefer home treatment, when severity is less so that, the one who is in need gets a bed in the hospital. We want to mention all details like devices required and medications, food to be taken and some physical activities that has to be done etc. We want to clear all the myths that are circulating through social media on various medications, Covid tests and vaccination too. We hope this effort of us will be useful in this unprecedented times.
